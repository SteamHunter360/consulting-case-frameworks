# ðŸ§­ 4. Consulting Project (Case Study Frameworks)
 
## ðŸ“– Overview

The Consulting Project â€“ Case Study Frameworks is a structured repository of consulting case study tools, notes, and practice exercises.

It demonstrates the ability to:
 - Break down complex business problems using frameworks (Profitability, Market Entry, M&A, Growth, etc.).
 - Apply structured problem-solving (hypothesis-driven approach).
 - Organize notes, worked examples, and mock case practice in a repeatable format.
 - Highlight transferable skills: analytical thinking, structured communication, and business acumen.

This project shows how engineering students can apply mechanical/software problem-solving skills to business consulting contexts.
A collection of problem-solving frameworks and worked examples for consulting prep.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans
- Add industry-specific cases (energy, aerospace, finance).
- Interactive case prep tools (Python-based).

## ðŸ“Œ Further Improvements
 1. Add more frameworks
 - Digital transformation, sustainability, pricing strategy.
 - Industry-specific frameworks (healthcare, finance, tech).

 2. Interactive tools
 - Build Python scripts to generate random practice prompts.
 - Add scoring rubrics for mock interviews.
